Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
The reason I believe we need data structure is because it will help us keep
data organized and easier to find within the system. These structure shows us many
possibilties of way data can be stored in.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Inserting, Deleting, Searching, Sorting and Merging
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Database Management System, Operating System, Compiler Design,

what is an Array?
Array is used to store block memory. Also we can say array is used to store a collection of data.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array has a fix-size and its fixed can not be changed,
ArrayList grow dynamically

what is LinkedList?
LinkedList is linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?

what is queue?
A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and
elements removed from the beginning of the queue.

what is stack?
It is a data structure that allows data to be inserted and removed.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
First-In-First-Out used by queue
Last-In-Last-Out used by stack

what is the order of complexity?

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Wouldn't would depend on the case, so answer may vary, it can be the best if the element is found at begging.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
It would depend on the case.

what is tree in data structure?
Known as non-leaner data structure, data are organized data hierarchically

what is graph in data structure?
Graph is set of items connected by edges. Each item is called a node.
A graph is a set of vertices and a binary relation between vertices.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable is synchronized  whereas hashMap is not synchronized.
HashTable does not allows null keys or values whereas HashMap allows null keys.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS,
Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
 Uses Graphs and Hierarchical data model uses Trees.



How HashMap works in java?
HashMap works on the principal of hashing.
HashMap stores both key and value object, in bucket, as an object of Entry class which implements the nested interface Map.Entry.
HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get key method for retrieving Values from HashMap
equals() method is used to compare objects for equality

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime Exception thrown only at runtime.
It occurs when Java program tries to access an invalid index, means an index which is not
 positive or greater than the length of an array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Object.clone()
Arrays.copyOf()
Arrays.copyOfRange()
System.arraycopy()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location.
In Linked list, location or addressof elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.
In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space in memory for pointer.
What is DFS and BFS?
Depth First Search: DFS is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a DFS, we go as deep as
possible down one path before backing up and trying a different one.
Here DFS explore one path, hit a dead end, and go back and try a different one.
Breadth First Search: BFS is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS,
we first explore all the nodes one step away, then

What is Recursion?
Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously.
A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Stack,Queue,Array and LinkedList are Liner data Structures.
Graph and Tree are both non- leaner data structure

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big-(O) notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm.
Big-(O) specifically describes how long will it take to run.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Quick sort
Bubble sort
Shell sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
